What is the value per share? (How much do we make per accepted share?)
Could artefact add the current share value to the stats?
Currently 0.00003625 BTC per share. I think Artefact2 decided against it because it isn't
completely
guaranteed. I suggested he show the price-per-share in the block list though.

Did you notice the hashing speed of the top contributor?
Lol.
Stats screenshot
That's about 20% of the whole pool.

Haha, we seem to have started off with a series of short blocks.  It might be a while before running into the case scenario where SMPPS actually activates.  Oh well, nigh-feeless PPS is good =)

I just wanted to post to say a great big THANKS to Luke-Jr and Artefact2 for the excellent work.
Payment method could not be more fair, in my view.
And without a need to create an account, it's one less password to keep safe for me. Pool mining could not be made easier. With all the hacks going on lately, my heart beats faster every time I log in to some other pool's account to check whether my BTC is still there or not.
For all doubters about the payment fairness, I've been mining for 3 weeks on Eligius pools and my total payment is 0.45% smaller than I would expect with my MH/s speed as found on
http://bitcoinx.com/profit/
(taking into account my downtime in this period - I keep my own stats - and taking into account the increasing difficulty in the meantime).
So bravo guys, and soon I will be increasing my hashing speed, get some more BTC and send a donation for your great pool.

maybe a silly question, but when do pay outs happen? every solved (and confirmed) block?
I might give this a try, seems to be a fair way of paying the miners...
P.S. whats up with the 63 GHash/s guy...WOW...botnet?

Anyone else still waiting for EU or US server payouts to arrive?
My EU server balance page has been showing "unknown server" (link:
http://eligius.st/~artefact2/eu/1F7NjSP5mN3s8C8c64R77ye4mdJEBimzmj
) for last couple of days, yet I'm still to receive my EU payout. I've been checking windows bitcoin client but still nothing. I've checked the Eligius main page and the FAQ but there seems to be no mention of the issue. How can they just shut down the server (including individual accounts) before making sure everyone has been paid out correctly? There must be hundreds who haven't mined for awhile but will never be able to check their old balance or to prove they ever had any.
I'm still waiting for my .7BTC (from memory) but it's been over 2 days now and I'm starting to get a bit impatient.

Yes, when each block is found, your "balance" is credited based on how many shares you contributed (your estimated reward becomes a real reward).  If that balance ends up being at least approx 0.34 BTC, the pool will pay you*.
*Occasionally, you may have to wait for one or two additional blocks after your balance passes 0.34 because of a backlog in payments.  Since the pool generally only pays out with "generate" transactions and those transaction are limited to 50BTC per block, long blocks (where the miners earned more than 50BTC cumulatively) may spill into the next block's generate.  Generally the combination of occasional short blocks and the fact that not everyone ends up with > 0.34 BTC on every block means that backlogs don't last long.  Of course your balance is still growing during this payout backlog, so you don't lose anything.

I haven't been using Eligius since the US server went down. I get far too many disconnects with the "new" Eligius, and, the long polling appears to be broken... I get rejects, then about 10 seconds later, long-polling notice...

Which port are you connecting on?  If I use 8337 it works okay, but if I use port 80 I get tremendous amounts of long polling errors. Not saying you should switch, but rather just trying to gauge if you are having the same issue
as me

8337, I'm afraid. Unless Phoenix sets long polling port separately. If so, howishot set it?

@artefact2:
would be nice to have info about btc generated in last 24h. lots of other pools have this displayed. it is very helpful to check if system works ok.
