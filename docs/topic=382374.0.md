Something that I immediately noticed was how the scriptPubKey's all start with OP_CODESEPARATOR

Also interesting is how there's a "getmywtxes" command in ProcessMessage, which looks like it's designed to get a thin-client's wallet transactions for them. Seems to be that it retrieves all transactions related to the specified scriptPubKey hashes in a specific block.
There's also a "wtx" command which seems to add a CWalletTx to the node's local wallet! Bizzare - quite possibly just some code for testing.
Accept block is fascinating, just look at the commend "Add atoms to user reviews for coins created" (?!)
You mean this is all he sent you; the source is obviously missing functions that are called and wouldn't have compiled. Pity, fascinating to see Bitcoin in this intermediate stage of development.


You're right about that;  The source itself refers to several header files that weren't in the source archive I received.  This is the stuff, I guess, that Satoshi felt that he needed pros to review.
